### ðŸŒ± Run Seed-Tools

#### UI Mode:
```
./seed-tools
```

#### Video Uploads:
This assumes a Movie or TV show upload. It will fetch tmdb/imdb/tvdb ids, create a sample, create screenshots, generate a description with all these goodies linked, and upload to the required tracker(s) 
```bash
./seed-tools.sh <input_path> -SP

./seed-tools.sh <input_path> -SP -TL
```
#### ðŸ“¤ Non-Video Upload (Skip All Checks)
Non-video upload, skip all filechecks and processing. The -0000 argument will be used as category id and type id for upload. i.e pass -1614 to uploads a PC game.
```
./seed-tools.sh <input_path> -SP -0000
```

```
./seed-tools.sh -sync
```

#### ðŸ”„ Pre-Flight Check
Collect TMDB/IMDB/TVDB IDs, audio track languages, and perform a dupe check on a release.
